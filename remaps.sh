# This script is called on startup to:
# 1. increase the key rate speed
# 2. change the behaviour of the caps lock key: map it to escape, but when it's pressed alongside another key, it's mapped to control
# 2. map the right alt to the super key.

# Increase key speed via a rate change.

xset r rate 300 75
